<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to the Lawtus app (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Sreekanth (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is provided on an "AS IS" basis.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
<p>
The Application <strong>does not collect, store, use, or share any personal or non-personal information</strong> from users.
</p>

<p>
No data is collected automatically or manually. The Application does not request access to device information, location data, IP addresses, usage statistics, or any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
<p>
The Application does not use any third-party services that collect user data. No information is shared with any external services, analytics providers, advertisers, or platforms.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
<p>
Since the Application does not collect any information, there is no data collection to opt out of. You may stop using the Application at any time by uninstalling it through your device’s standard uninstall process.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>
<p>
The Service Provider does not retain any user data because no user data is collected by the Application.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>
<p>
The Application does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data collection occurs, there is no risk of data being stored or processed from children.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Security</strong>
<p>
Because the Application does not collect or store any information, no user data is processed or maintained, and therefore no personal data is at risk.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the Application after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
</p>

<br>

<p><strong>This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2026-01-13</strong></p>

<br>

<strong>Your Consent</strong>
<p>
By using the Application, you acknowledge that the Application does not collect or process any personal data.
